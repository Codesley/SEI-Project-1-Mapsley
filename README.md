# Mapsley Trivia

## Project Description

Mapsley is an in-browser trivia game that is based on U.S. geography. The name itself is a play on my actual name "Kingsley" and the idea originated from me having minored in geography during my undergrad. The main goal of the game is to test the user's knowledge of United States geography by asking them fifteen questions. Each question has four options the user can choose from. Once the user picks their answer, they are taken to the next question. Upon completing the final question, the user is taken to the results screen that shows them the correct amount of answers they achieved. In this game, having ten correct answers or more will be considered a victory, while having less will be considered a loss.

Originally when planning Mapsley, I wanted to create three different sections of the screen that I could manipulate through javascript as the game progressed. The top portion would contain the title, question number, and number of questions answered correctly. The middle portion would contain a brief description of the game, the question, and a message decaring if the user had won or loss. Lastly, the bottom portion would contain the answer choices, as well as a start and reset button.

The user begins the game on this title screen that gives a brief description on what the trivia is based on. From here the user can begin the game by pressing start.

Mapsley has a total of fifteen questions. The user is given the question with an option of four answer choices. From here the user must pick the choice they believe is correct. Once the user clicks their choice, they cannot change their answer and are taken to the next screen.

Once the user has finished all the questions, they will be taken to the results page that shows the amount of questions they got correct, as well as a brief message denoting whether or not they won. From here the user can restart the game by pressing the reset button.

## Project Difficulties

* Shuffling the options and answer locations so that the answer was not always in the same box.
* Creating a counter to count how many questions the user got correct.
* Making the game more visually appealing.

## Future Goals

* Implement features that lets users know their current score and whether or not they got the answer right or wrong. 
* Create a score list that logs user names with their best score.
* Optimize the CSS so that the game looks refined on a multitude of platforms (Mobile, tablet, etc.).
