# Mapsley Trivia

## Project Description

Mapsley is an in-browser trivia game that is based on U.S. geography. The name itself is a play on my actual name "Kingsley" and the idea originated from me having minored in geography during my undergrad. The main goal of the game is to test the user's knowledge of United States geography by asking them fifteen questions. Each question has four options the user can choose from. Once the user picks their answer, they are taken to the next question. Upon completing the final question, the user is taken to the results screen that shows them the correct amount of answers they achieved. In this game, having ten correct answers or more will be considered a victory, while having less will be considered a loss.

## Technologies Used

## Project Difficulties

* Shuffling the options and answer locations so that the answer was not always in the same box.
* Creating a counter to count how many questions the user got correct.
* Making the game more visually appealing.

## Future Goals

* Create a score list that logs user names with their best score.
* Optimize the CSS so that the game looks refined on a multitude of platforms (Mobile, tablet, etc.).
